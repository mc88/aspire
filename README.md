Project is not finished, because 3 hours is not enough to do this
Solution builds (I use VS 2017) but WPF part not works.
I use Entity Framework to store contacts, database 'Aspire' should be automatically created when you run WebApi. By default it uses SQLEXPRESS, connection string can be changed in Startup.cs file in WPFAspire.WebApi project
Some areas which are not done, but certainly should be: 
- some fixes in business logic (eg. editing and deleting phone numbers and emails)
- better api configuration
- better exception handling and logging functionality (eg. log4net)
- unit tests
- wpf application (I don't have exprience with WPF)
